Welcome to the ultimate in sexy administration tools. Please review the links above for easy administration.  This tool was developed by God Xanitex from TNT Open Tibia Server. Feature requests can be made on OTLand, but I cannot guarantee a timely response to implementing these features. This management interface leverages Bootstrap, a sleek and powerful front-end web interface developed by Twitter and jQuery.

This web application currently only supports sha1 for password hashing and requires the page_access column from Gesior's AAC. By setting the page access value, please keep in mind that this will provide other access within Gesior's AAC as well if you are using Gesior's AAC.

The delete player functionality has not actually been coded. This is still a beta release.
