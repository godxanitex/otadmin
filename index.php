<h4>Open Tibia Management Interface</h4>
<p>Welcome to the ultimate in sexy administration tools. Please review the links above for easy administration.</p>
<p>This tool was developed by <a href="http://otland.net/members/xanitex/">God Xanitex</a> from <a href="https://www.tntopentibia.com/">TNT Open Tibia Server</a>. Feature requests can be made on OTLand, but I cannot guarantee a timely response to implementing these features. This management interface leverages <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>, a sleek and powerful front-end web interface developed by Twitter and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.</p>
<p>You may download this web-application from my <a href="https://github.com/godxanitex/otadmin">GitHub link</a>.</p>
